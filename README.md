# This is a slightly upgraded code for the Snake Game. I have modified it so that when the snake goes into the border, it does not simply stop and lose a life, but its head goes to another border of the canvas and then loses a life. (when you go up beyond the canvas, the head appears down below, and vice versa). Additionally, I added lives and scorecount at the bottom (lives reduced from 5 to 3).
